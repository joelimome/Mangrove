<h2> Delete report: "{{ report.name }}"</h2>

<p>Are you sure you want to delete this report ?</p>

<!-- .
You won't find any python view for this template cause it uses a django generic_view
as it doesn't do anything complicated (deleting a report is just calling report.delete()).
You'll find the django generic_view in the urls.py.

This is a standard template for the django generic_view to delete something with
a confirmation: it will display confirmation on GET, but delete on POST, hence
this form.

It's very nice for interacting with AJAX, as you can just POST to the generic view
to delete the object.

<form method="post" action=".">
    <p class="confirm">
    <a href="{% url dashboard %}">Cancel</a>
    <input value="yes, Delete" type="submit" />
    </p>
    {% csrf_token %}
</form>
